    Combat System: You can expand the combat system by adding more enemies with different abilities, allowing the player to choose their actions during battles (such as using skills or items), and implementing a turn-based system where both the player and enemies take turns attacking.

    Quests and Objectives: Introduce quests or objectives for the player to complete. These can involve defeating specific enemies, finding rare items, or reaching certain locations. Implement a quest log or tracking system to help the player keep track of their progress.

    NPC Interactions: Include non-playable characters (NPCs) in your game that the player can interact with. NPCs can provide valuable information, give quests, sell items, or offer services like healing or upgrading equipment.

    Leveling and Progression: Implement a leveling system where the player can gain experience points through battles or completing quests. As the player levels up, allow them to allocate skill points to enhance their character's abilities or learn new skills.

    Shop and Economy: Introduce shops where the player can buy and sell items, weapons, and equipment. Create an in-game economy with currency that the player can earn through battles or by completing quests.

    Exploration and World Building: Expand the game world by creating multiple locations for the player to explore. Each location can have unique enemies, treasures, and secrets. Consider adding descriptive text or narratives to enhance the atmosphere and immerse the player in the game world.
